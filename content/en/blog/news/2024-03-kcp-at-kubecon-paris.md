[KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2024](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/) is around the corner and we can't wait to see you in Paris!

We are happy to tell you that kcp and several of its maintainers will be present and hope to chat a lot about the project. This will be kcp's first KubeCon + CloudNativeCon as [CNCF Sandbox project]({{< relref "./2024-01-joining-the-cncf-sandbox.md" >}}) and we couldn't be more excited about joining KubeCon + CloudNativeCon as a CNCF project.

Currently, the following sessions will cover kcp (schedule might be subject to change):
