A year after kcp.io launched as the project website, we have big news to share. kcp is joining the CNCF and becomes a CNCF Sandbox project. A huge thanks to the sponsors of [our application](https://github.com/cncf/sandbox/issues/47). We are excited to join an amazing community of open source projects!

If you haven't checked in with the kcp project in a while, let us bring you up to speed on the last few months. In April this year, Red Hat [announced](https://groups.google.com/g/kcp-users/c/yTe8RMcpxrg) that kcp won't have its immediate focus and extended an invitation to the community to take over the project.

A group of committed organizations and individuals decided to respond to the call for action and established a [new project governance](https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md) and bootstrapped a [new list of maintainers](https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp/pull/2953) to lead kcp as a community project. Since then, more people have joined the list of maintainers to drive the kcp project forward. We relaunched kcp.io in a new design recently to commemorate the "new" kcp project.

From the inception of the new project governance, it was clear that kcp does not exist in a vacuum. It is a citizen of the Kubernetes ecosystem and as such, joining the CNCF to formalize that citizenship was the obvious and natural road to take. Eventually, after evaluating our application, the [Technical Oversight Committee (TOC)](https://www.cncf.io/people/technical-oversight-committee/) decided to accept us into the CNCF Sandbox program.

Obviously, we are beyond excited about this decision and about the amazing community of open source projects we are joining. It is incredibly humbling to become a part of the CNCF community - in a way, it feels like coming home.

We have many plans for the remainder of 2023, for 2024, and for the time beyond. Adding functionality vital to the mission of kcp, improving the experience of running kcp on top of Kubernetes, spreading the word about building scalable control planes for SaaS-like services, growing the community - You name it. We hope to see you on our bi-weekly community meetings or on our GitHub repositories soon!
