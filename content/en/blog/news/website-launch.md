Welcome to the website of the kcp project. We have come a long way from the
[first commit 
to the kcp project on July 7 2020](https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp/commit/01ff3300345f1094d1ce7ad4da323ccbba81ca3a), to the project we see today. We started with an experiment
to add logical clusters to kube-apiserver, and we've evolved into a tool that enables 
large scale multi-tenant services based on the Kubernetes API.

Today we are proud to announce the kcp website:

<a href="https://kcp.io">
<img src="/images/kcp-io.png#center" alt="kcp – Simplifying building massively multi-tenant services. Together."/>
</a>

We love collaboration. Together, we can change the world.
